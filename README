qarv - a Qt interface to Aravis
===============================

DESCRIPTION
-----------

qarv provides a graphical user interface to GeniCam ethernet cameras
via the Aravis library. It allows viewing the video and recording it
in the original format. OpenGL is used for video output. The network
interface used by the camera is automatically detected and camera's
packet size is set to match the interface MTU, providing usable
(hopefully) performance with minimal interaction, unlike the default
settings on some cameras. Basic controls, such as frames-per-second,
pixel format and exposure/gain are provided. Region-of-interest can be
selected via manual entry or by drawing it directly in the video
display. Full access to all camera features is planned for a future
release.

For a programmer, qarv provides the ArCam and ArCamId classes which
isolate the Qt program from Aravis internals, thus avoiding clashes
between Qt and Glib/GTK. This interface is provided in
src/ArCam.{h,cpp} files and may be used in other projects. If you do
use it, drop us a mail; we will create a stand-alone library if there
is sufficient interest.

REQUIREMENTS AND INSTALLATION
-----------------------------

qarv requires Qt-4.8 and aravis-0.2. At the time of this writing, the
API-frozen version or aravis has not yet been released, so use the
latest git version.

qarv is built using CMake with no special configuration
options. If you are not familiar with CMake, refer to any
tutorial. But for starters, run these commands from the qarv
directory:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  sudo make install  # optional!

You can skip the "make install" step and run qarv from the build
directory directly.
