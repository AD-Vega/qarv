qarv - a Qt interface to Aravis
===============================

DESCRIPTION
-----------

qarv provides a graphical user interface to GeniCam ethernet cameras
via the Aravis library. It allows viewing the video and recording it
in either the original or AVI formats. OpenGL is used for video
display. The network interface used by the camera is automatically
detected and camera's packet size is set to match the interface MTU,
providing usable (hopefully) performance with minimal interaction,
unlike the default settings on some cameras. Basic controls, such as
frames-per-second, pixel format and exposure/gain are
provided. Region-of-interest can be selected via manual entry or by
drawing it directly in the video display. Full access to all camera
features is available in a tree view.

For a programmer, qarv provides the ArCam and ArCamId classes which
isolate the Qt program from Aravis internals, thus avoiding clashes
between Qt and Glib/GTK. The ArCam class implements the
QAbstractItemModel interface. This interface allows direct access to
camera features using Qt's Model/View paradigm. The ArCam model can
thus be plugged directly into a "view" widget, as is done in the
GUI. An implementation of QStyledItemDelegate is also provided; it
generates widgets that can be used to edit Aravis feature nodes. All
this functionality is provided in src/ArCam.{h,cpp} files and may be
used in other projects. If you do use it, drop us a mail; we will
create a stand-alone library if there is sufficient interest.

REQUIREMENTS AND INSTALLATION
-----------------------------

qarv requires Qt-4.8 and aravis-0.2. It can use the ffmpeg command (if
present) to record AVIs, but it is not necessary for recording raw
data.

qarv is built using CMake with no special configuration
options. If you are not familiar with CMake, refer to any
tutorial. But for starters, run these commands from the qarv
directory:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  sudo make install  # optional!

You can skip the "make install" step and run qarv from the build
directory directly, although there might be problems with localization
and icon loading.
