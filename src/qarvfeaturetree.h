//! A class that stores the hirearchy of camera features.
/*! String identifiers are used to get feature nodes from Aravis. At first it
 * seems that a QAbstractItemModel can be implemented by only using Aravis
 * functions to walk the feature hirearchy, but it turns out there is no way
 * to find a feature's parent that way. Also, string identifiers returned by
 * Aravis are not persistent and need to be copied. Therefore, a tree to store
 * feature identifiers is used by the model. It is assumed that the hirearchy
 * is static.
